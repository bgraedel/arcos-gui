# Installation

If napari is not yet installed, install it with [pip]:

```
pip install napari[all]
```

It is better to do this in a new virtual environment to avoid dependency issues.

If you don't have python or [pip][] installed checkout [anaconda][]/[miniconda][] or this [Python installation guide][]
which can guide you through the process.

After successfully installing napari, you can install `arcos-gui` via [pip]:

    pip install arcos-gui

This is the preferred method to install arcos-gui, as it will always install the most recent stable release.

To install the most recent development version :

    pip install git+https://github.com/bgraedel/arcos-gui.git
